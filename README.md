# PVO-city-explorer
Working with server-to-browser backend to frontend

# Project Name
City Explorer

**Author**: Paul O'Brien
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

  Taking in data to a backend server, that is currently then sending non-dynamic, just-pulling-from-a-json-file data back to the front end. Eventually, it will show dynamic information for what the user puts in, but currently, "it works".
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
 
 Get heroku and github synced up, have your computer all connected right for easy ACP via VS Code, and head on to the next section...
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

  The environment requires vs code (maybe not requires, but you need an editor), some flavor of linux, then node.js, and then install express, dotenv, and cors. set up your PORT=[PORT] in your .env file, then you're pretty much set to code, and all that's left is the doing of it.

  For later steps, you will be required to go out and get api keys. As of 2020-07-13 I'm uncertain how they play in yet.
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log

07-13-2020 7:30pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
